1. Upload .apk file to Saucelab for testing:
-----------------------------------------
If we are using sauce labs for Testing. Then we need to upload the apk file to sauce lab
First we need to install Curl on Agent server because saucelabs api needs this to connect from windows to sauce labs.

If you have Git for Windows installed (if you downloaded Git from git-scm.com, the answer is yes), you have curl.exe under:

 C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\
Simply add the above path to PATH to system Environment variables and Local variables.

C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\

If you are running from server above path is fine. When you are execting from the build the the build fails as
curl is not recognized as internal or external command. so you need to add below path to system environment variables and Local variables.
C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\curl.exe

Add below script in command prompt:

D:
cd $(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\
curl -u "MedojuB2:AccessKey" -X POST "https://api.us-west-1.saucelabs.com/v1/storage/upload" --form payload=@"$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)/app-debug.apk" -v

2. Upload apk to Device Farm using Python
-----------------------------------------
you can try below using Visual code on Agent server first.
Install python on Agent Server
pip install boto3
pip install boto3[crt]

# for Reference Python Code https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/api-ref.html#automation-example

import boto3
import os
import requests
import string
import random
import datetime
import time
import urllib3

client = boto3.client('devicefarm')

#http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/devicefarm.html#DeviceFarm.Client.create_upload

response = client.create_upload(projectArn="<arn>",name="app-debug.apk",type='ANDROID_APP')
#create the s3 bucket to store the upload test suite
uploadArn = response['upload']['arn']
preSignedUrl = response['upload']['url']
print('uploadArn: ' + uploadArn + '\n')
print('pre-signed url: ' + preSignedUrl + '\n')

#print the status of the upload
#http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/devicefarm.html#DeviceFarm.Client.get_upload
status = client.get_upload(arn=uploadArn)
print("S3 Upload Bucket Status: " + status['upload']['status'] + '\n')

print("Uploading file...")
preSignedUrl1 = '"' + preSignedUrl + '"'
print(preSignedUrl1)
#os.popen('curl -T "$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\app-debug.apk" $preSignedUrl1 -insecure -v').read() 
#os.system('curl -T "$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\app-debug.apk" $preSignedUrl1 -insecure -v')
os.system('curl -X POST $preSignedUrl1 --form payload=@"$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)/app-debug.apk" -v')
#open the file and make payload
#payload = {'file':open(r"$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)/app-debug.apk",'rb')}
#try and perform the upload
#r = requests.put(url = preSignedUrl,files = payload)
#print the response code back
#print(r)
print("upload done")
del(preSignedUrl)
