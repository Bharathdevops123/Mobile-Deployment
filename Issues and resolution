Issues and resolution
1) How to run shell commands in Windows:
--------------------------------------
If you have installed Git in your machine then you can add below path to your system environment variables.
C:\Program Files\Git\bin
Add bash before to the .sh files in package.json
Example: "release-qa-reset": "bash ./build/releaseQAreset.sh",


2) We also need to install win-node-env
This will set common environment variables
npm install -g win-node-env

Need to add this dependency in package.json
   "devDependencies": {
      "win-node-env": "^0.6.1"
}

3)Error: This command was run via npm module 'win-node-env'
solution: modify the command to npm run env NODE_ENV=production
